We will use the petition to show Olin and the Board of Trustees that the solar initiative has support from students and staff. Quite frankly, without support from Oliners, it will be difficult to convince the Board that this is a cause worth pursuing. At Olin, we do things together, or not at all. <br><br> Visit the GrOW facebook page and leave comments, and share the page on your facebook/twitter/tumbler accounts. The more people know about the initiative, the better. <br><br> Join the debate here! Discussion and deliberation are key to understanding the needs of the Olin community surrounding the topic of solar energy on campus. We want to hear your ideas, reactions, concerns, and excitement!</div>";
